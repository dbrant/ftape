Hey, Emacs, we're -*-Text-*- mode!

This directory contains a patches which are necessary to compile and
run this version of the ftape driver with Linux v1.2.x.

********************************************************************
*                                                                  *
* Don't apply this patch if you are running other kernel versions. *
*                                                                  *
********************************************************************

To apply the patches, change to the directory where the Linux v1.2.x
kernel sources are located. Probably this is `/usr/src/linux/' or
similar and use the `patch' command like follows:

cd /usr/src/linux/
patch -p1 < /usr/src/ftape-4.00/patches/v1.2/linux-1.2.13.dif
patch -p1 < /usr/src/ftape-4.00/patches/v1.2/linux-1.2.13.dif2

where you have to replace `/usr/src/ftape-4.00/' by the name of the
directory where the ftape driver sources are located in.

Afterwards you have to recompile your kernel and reinstall it. The
safest way to do so is the following

cd /usr/src/linux/
make dep
make clean
make zImage
make modules
make modules_install

You probably will have to replace the `make zImage' by the proper
command to make and install your kernel image. Possibilities are `make
zlilo' or `make zdisk'. But this depends on your setup. If you got
your Linux system as a CD distribution, then you probably also got a
handbook where the necessary steps how to compile and install a new
kernel version are explained.

The files `io.h' and `wrapper.h' in this directory are intended for
the case where the `patch' command fails, probably because your kernel
sources are already heavily patched. In this case, you still can
change the kernel sources with little effort. Please refer to the
`ftape-manual'. The file `README' in the top level directory of the
ftape driver sources tells you where to obtain the `ftape-manual'.
