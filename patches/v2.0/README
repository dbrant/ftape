Hey, Emacs, we're -*-Text-*- mode!

This directory contains a patch to the

[/usr/src/linux/]drivers/block/floppy.c 

floppy driver for Linux v2.0.x.

********************************************************************
*                                                                  *
* Don't apply this patch if you are running other kernel versions. *
*                                                                  *

Unluckily, the v2.0.x floppy driver (as of Linux v2.0.35 and earlier
versions) unconditionally grabs the IO ports of the floppy controller
(FDC) and don't release them back even when the floppy isn't in
use. This is definitely a bug in the floppy driver.

To work around this problems, one either can define the
`-DBROKEN_FLOPPY_DRIVER' option in the `MCONFIG' file of the ftape
kernel driver distribution. Or one can apply the patch in this
directory.

The first solution is deprecated, as it simply tells ftape to skip the
IO region checking. In this case you have to be very careful not to
use the floppy while the tape device is in use, and vice
versa. Otherwise you most probably will get Kernel Oopses.

The second solution really fixes this problem; it changes the floppy
driver so that it releases ALL resources back to the system when the
floppy isn't in use, and to properly check whether the corresponding
IO regions aren't occupied by other drivers (such as ftape) before
accessing the FDC registers.

Of course, if you don't want to plug your tape drive into the standard
floppy controller, then you don't need this patch and can live with
the buggy floppy driver.

To apply this patch, change to the directory where the Linux v2.0.x
kernel sources are located. Probably this is `/usr/src/linux/' or
similar and use the `patch' command like follows:

cd /usr/src/linux/
patch -p1 < /usr/src/ftape-4.00/patches/v2.0/floppy.c.dif

where you have to replace

/usr/src/ftape-4.00/patches/v2.0/floppy.c.dif

by the real pathname of the `floppy.c.dif' which is located in the
same directory as this `README' file.

Afterwards you have to recompile your kernel and reinstall it. The
safest way to do so is the following

cd /usr/src/linux/
make dep
make clean
make zImage
make modules
make modules_install

You probably will have to replace the `make zImage' by the proper
command to make and install your kernel image. Possibilities are `make
zlilo' or `make zdisk'. But this depends on your setup. If you got
your Linux system as a CD distribution, then you probably also got a
handbook where the necessary steps how to compile and install a new
kernel version are explained.
