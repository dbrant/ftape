Hey, Emacs, we're -*-Text-*- mode!

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

This directory and its subdirectories contain the sources for

                            ftape-4.04a

`ftape'  is a  device driver  for floppy tape  drives written  for the
operating system Linux.

Currently, the  driver  supports many  QIC-40/QIC-80/QIC-3010/QIC-3020
tape   drives that   conform   to  the respective   QIC-*  development
standards, as well as the Iomega Ditto 2GB and Max drives.

Some parallel port tape drives are  also supported, too. These are the
Colorado Trakker and  several kinds of parallel  port  drives that use
the Micro   Solutions' "Backpack"   protocol, i.e. the    Iomega Ditto
parallel port  drives, and some parallel  port floppy tape drives made
by Exabyte and Seagate.

4. RTFM and problem reports, questions, contacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`RTFM' is a shortcut for `Read those fine manuals'.

Feel free to contact me if something goes wrong, but first try to read
the available  manuals. The   `ftape-manual'   comes with  a    fairly
extensive index so you can search for suitable keywords there and jump
directly to suitable passages in the  manual without having to read it
in its entirety.

Please post your questions to the `linux-tape' mailing list:

        linux-tape@vger.rutgers.edu

You can  benefit from the experiences  of other people that share your
problems.

If you want to subscribe to the mailing list, send mail to 

        majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu

with the text

        subscribe linux-tape 

in the message body.

NOTE: PLEASE  DON'T   POST LARGE  MESSAGES TO THE    MAILING LIST (for
example  large  excerpts of your  kernel  log files).  I'm not talking
about 5 kilobyte  mails. But if your  message exceeds 10kb or so, then
think  a  moment  about  whether this    mail  is really    of general
interest. If you  find it necessary to  send large emails to me,  then
send them directly to

        heine@instmath.rwth-aachen.de

Please keep in mind that  quite a lot  of people might read the  Linux
tape  mailing  list, and  some  of them  might  have to  pay for their
Internet connection. Don't waste the mailing list bandwidth.

Please try to describe your problem as exact as possible. I can't help
if  you simply send  me messages like  `ftape  doesn't work'. SO WHAT! 
Please include the version of the kernel you  are running, the version
of  ftape you are using  and (of course)  tell  me what kind of floppy
tape you are using.

If   you encountered errors during  tape  operation, try to provide an
exact     command  sequence  that     reproduces   the  error if  ever
possible. Please don't send me messages  like `ftape sometimes doesn't
skip   to  the next file'.   Instead, give  me  the  exact sequence of
commands that  you  typed in  when the  unexpected  behaviour or error
occurred, if ever possible.

Please don't feel annoyed if it takes some days before you get a reply
to your email (or  don't get any  reply at all). I get  quite a lot of
messages, and I'm  doing the ftape  support in  my spare time.  Simply
resend your  message if you have the  impression that you don't get an
answer (gimme  a break: please wait  a couple of days before resending
your email)


Have fun

Claus-Justus Heine <heine@instmath.rwth-aachen.de>
