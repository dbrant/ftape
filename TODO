Hey, Emacs, we're -*-Text-*- mode!

"-" means not done, "*" in progress, "+" done, "?" means contradictory
test results or error reports and total confusion of the Ftape
maintainer.

(-) Formatting cartridges with Colorado Jumbo 350 drives is broken. As
    usual, Colorado gives zero support.

(-) Have a look at Jochen Hoenickes suggestions for better handling of
    "no data errors" during verification of a newly formatted
    cartridge.

(-) Use GNU autoconf to figure out all those compatibility problems
    and installation paths. Will probably never be done.

(-) Support the FC-20 at 2Mbps. As usual Colorado (i.e. Hewlett
    Packard) gives zero support. Not a single response from their
    support team, not even a short note stating `We don't support
    Linux' :-(

(* or +) There are still "fdc_read timeout" errors. This is caused by
    insufficient communication between the driver and its isr().
    I think this is fixed now, so: "+"?

(*) There are still deadlocks possible that cannot be aborted with a
    signal. This really needs to be fixed. Maybe (+), unsure (?).

(?) There are TR-3 EXtra cartridges out there that (sometimes?) are
    detected as QIC-3010 (should be QIC-3020). Strange.

(*) Push the whole thing into the kernel.

(*) Update the documentation. This is a never ending story. But nearly
    (+), now.

(-) Maybe use GNU autoconf/automake. Would be nice.
