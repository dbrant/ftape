1. Preliminaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What you need:

a) a floppy tape drive (of course).

b) a  recent version of the Linux  kernel. ftape still might work with
   Linux v1.2.13 but I haven't tested it. v2.0.x and later should work
   just fine.

c) utilities  for loading  kernel modules, i.e.  `modutils-2.x.x'. You
   can get  them from the  same locations  where you  can download the
   Linux          kernel                  sources                from.
   (e.g.   `ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/utils/kernel/modutils')   Please
   read `[/usr/src/linux/]Documentation/modules.txt' also.

   BIG   FAT WARNING: do not  use   modutils-2.0.0 -- or   to be  more
   precise:  in case you   encounter  problems with loading  the ftape
   modules,  upgrade  to a   more    recent version  of the   modutils
   package.

   The modutils packages   are intended  to be backwards   compatible,
   i.e.  you should be  able to  use the  latest modutils package with
   older kernels.

d) The sources of the kernel you intend  to run `ftape' with. It might
   be possible that you can live without it. In this case refer to the
   remarks at the beginning of the `MCONFIG' file in this directory.

e) Usual utilities to compile C source code (make, gcc, ld, as, etc.).
   You probably don't need to worry about this point.

f) In case you have a `Ditto EZ' controller, the you need a package to
   configure `Plug'n Play' cards as well. One package is `isapnptools'
   to be obtained from

        http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/

   This package isn't needed   any  longer when using  ftape-4.03  (or
   later) with linux-2.4.0 (or later).



2. Read the file `README'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please read the file `README'  in this directory. It lists  additional
documentation  and packages that  might be useful  when  trying to use
`ftape'.  It  is strongly recommended  that you obtain the `ftape-doc'
and  the `ftape-tools'  package as well.    Please  refer to  the file
`README'.



3. Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. `cd' to the directory  containing the sources of `ftape-4.04a'. You
   probably already  have done this.  Edit the file `MCONFIG'  in this
   directory and try    to    follow  the  instructions      contained
   therein.   Most settings which   are  tunable  in `MCONFIG' can  be
   changed   at   module  load  time by   setting   appropriate module
   parameters.   Examples     are  given  below   and   in   the  file
   `./modules/insert'.

2. If you are using Linux v1.2.13 or v2.0.x,  then you should consider
   to apply the patches  under `./patches/v1.2' or `./patches/v2.0' to
   your   kernel.   Please     refer to  `./patches/v1.2/README'   and
   `./patches/v2.0'  README for  more information.  After applying the
   patches you will have to recompile and install your new kernel.

3. Type  `make'  to  compile `ftape-4.04a'.   There   shouldn't be any
   warnings  and  no errors.   If  you get warnings  or  errors during
   compilation, then  please check  first  whether  the value   of the
   variable  `LINUX_LOCATION'  in the  file  `./MCONFIG' is set to the
   location of your  kernel    source tree.  The kernel   source  tree
   (probably  `/usr/src/linux')  should  have been configured properly
   prior to attempting to compile `ftape', and you should have typed a
   `make dep' in the directory containing the kernel sources (probably
   `/usr/src/linux').

4. If everything went fine try to install  the package by typing `make
   install'. Per default this will install the kernel modules under

   /lib/modules/KERNELRELEASE/misc/

   where KERNELRELEASE refers to a number like `2.0.35' and stands for
   the version   of the  kernel you  compiled  `ftape'  for, i.e.  the
   version of  the   kernel which's   sources  are  contained  in  the
   directory  you have specified with   the LINUX_LOCATION variable in
   the file `./MCONFIG'.

5. Try to  test   load the driver   by  changing to the   `./modules/'
   directory and typing `. insert'  to execute the commands  contained
   in `./modules/insert' file.    Please   read through   that    file
   first. You will have to change some values like  the IO base of the
   FDC controller and such. If  you have edited `./modules/insert'  to
   reflect your setup, then `cd' to the modules directory and load the
   modules with

   cd modules/
   . insert

   If this  fails, then please refer  to  the `ftape-4.x-doc' package,
   the  `Ftape-FAQ'   and the  `Ftape-HOWTO'.   Please  read  the file
   `README' for   information  where  to  obtain the   `ftape-4.x-doc'
   package.

6. Test the driver by running some small  backup and restore sessions.
   If you  don't  know how  to  do this,  then   please  refer to  the
   `ftape-manual' contained  in the  `ftape-4.x-doc' package. Read the
   file `README' in this   directory for informations about  where  to
   obtain it from and what else might be available.

   The `ftape-tools' package contains some test cases which can be run
   with the command  `make  check'  when compiling the   `ftape-tools'
   package.

7. Before trying  to recompile  the driver  for another  kernel source
   tree (e.g. if   you have a   "stable"  kernel source  tree  and one
   unstable you are playing with) you should run

   make distclean

   This   removes   a couple    of  files  which   would  hinder   the
   recompilation.



4. Autoloading via kerneld or kmod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are  three examples how to  set up `/etc/conf.modules'. They are
meant  as   examples only. I   assume that   the  modules are  already
installed  in the right place under `/lib/modules/KERNELRELEASE/misc/'
where `modprobe' can find them. You have to adjust  the values for the
IO base, IRQ channel and DMA channel yourself.  The values given below
are nonsense.

	PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU NEED TO LOAD AT LEAST ftape.o AND
	zftape.o AND ONE OF THE FDC MODULES bpck-fdc.o,
	ftape-internal.o or trakker.o.

The  examples   given  below    are   meant   to  be  added   to   the
`/etc/conf.modules'   file,  otherwise  they   don't  make any   sense
(i.e. don't try to type them in at the shell  prompt ...). Please make
sure that there is no other

alias char-major-27   SOMETHING

line in  `/etc/conf.modules'. If  there  is  one, comment  it  out  by
inserting.  a hash (i.e. `#') character right at the beginning of that
line. You need to be `root' to edit `/etc/conf.modules'.

1. single internal tape drive, FDC controller located at 0x4711, using
   IRQ channel 42, and DMA channel 13

        alias char-major-27       zftape
        options ftape ft_fdc_driver=ftape-internal,none,none,none
        options ftape-internal ft_fdc_base=0x4711 ft_fdc_irq=42 ft_fdc_dma=13
        pre-install ftape-internal /usr/local/bin/swapout 15

   Note the `swapout'  program might  be  installed elsewhere than  in
   `/usr/local/bin/'. Or not installed at all. It  is contained in the
   `ftape-tools' package. See `./README'.

2. single  parallel port tape drive,  using  the `trakker' module. The
   parallel port is  located  at 0x378, 0x278   or 0x3bc so   that the
   trakker module can  find it itself, or  you are using the `parport'
   interface with the  v2.1.x kernels. In that  case, be sure to  tell
   the  `parport'     module  which  interrupt    to   use   and  read
   `[/usr/src/linux/]Documentation/parport.txt'.

        alias char-major-27       zftape
        options ftape ft_fdc_driver=trakker,none,none,none

3. Same as 2), but with `bpck-fdc' module.

        alias char-major-27       zftape
        options ftape ft_fdc_driver=bpck-fdc,none,none,none

4. Same as 2.) and 3.), but with both parallel port modules

        alias char-major-27       zftape
        options ftape ft_fdc_driver=bpck-fdc:trakker,none,none,none

   `ftape' will pick the  FDC module which  thinks it has detected the
   hardware properly.

5. Internal tape drive as under 1.),  but additionally a parallel port
   tape drive using `/dev/qft1':

        alias char-major-27       zftape
        options ftape ft_fdc_driver=ftape-internal,bpck-fdc:trakker,none,none
        options ftape-internal ft_fdc_base=0x4711 ft_fdc_irq=42 ft_fdc_dma=13
        pre-install ftape-internal /usr/local/bin/swapout 15

   Note the `swapout'  program might  be  installed elsewhere than  in
   `/usr/local/bin/'. Or not installed at all.  It is contained in the
   `ftape-tools' package. See `./README'.


Good luck
